### Build

Just use the cmake:

```bash
# from cli:
mkdir build # first time only
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can also use the ide.

In fact most of them can peek-up cmake projects in few clicks.

Another option is to ask the cmake to generate project files (run cmake --help, and look to the output).
